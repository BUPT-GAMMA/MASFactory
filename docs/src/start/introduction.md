# Project Introduction

**MASFactory** is a **VibeGraphing-first** orchestration framework for multi-agent workflows. It is designed around a structure-first workflow: start from intent, produce a workflow draft quickly, and iteratively converge to runnable, reusable, traceable multi-agent systems.

It unifies workflow design, orchestration, visual preview, and runtime tracing in one path—built for complex, multi-stage, multi-role agentic systems.

## Recommended learning path

- Step 1: Run the minimal example in [First Code](/start/the_first_code).
- Step 2: Read [Declarative vs Imperative](/start/declarative_vs_imperative) to learn two graph authoring styles.
- Step 3: Follow [Progressive Tutorials](/progressive/) to build a simplified ChatDev in three paradigms (Declarative / Imperative / VibeGraph).

## Why Choose MASFactory

- 🎨 **VibeGraphing: natural-language driven orchestration:** Start from intent, generate a workflow structure draft, and iteratively refine it in a visual environment for faster design and iteration.
- 🧩 **Composable graphs: scale from simple to complex:** Build workflows as graphs with reusable building blocks. Evolve from small flows to multi-stage, branching, and looping systems without rewriting everything.
- 🔍 **Visualization and tracing:** Preview topology and inspect runtime behavior to understand what happens and iterate with confidence.
- 🧠 **Context protocol adapters:** A unified way to organize context from memory, retrieval, and external providers—more controllable, manageable, and traceable for long-running systems.
