features:
  - title: "🎨 VibeGraphing: natural-language driven design experience"
    details: "Shift from “doing” to “designing”: co-design and iterate multi-agent systems through a dialogue with AI, starting from intent and converging to an executable structure."

  - title: "🧩 Graph “building blocks”: atomic nodes and composite components"
    details: "Use graphs as the core unit of capability composition. Package subgraphs as reusable nodes, and assemble complex workflows with lower overhead through declarative structure reuse."

  - title: "🔍 Visualization and white-box debugging"
    details: "With MASFactory Visualizer, preview topology and trace runtime behavior end to end, so you can locate control-flow and messaging issues with lower iteration cost."

  - title: "🧠 Context protocol adapters"
    details: "Unify multi-source context (memory, retrieval, external knowledge, and tool results) into a consistent organization and injection protocol—more controllable, manageable, and traceable."
